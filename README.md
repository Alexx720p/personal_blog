I used Django for this project
You can run the project by moving to the project directory and running python manage.py runserver

The design/frontend is pretty bad I know but it works, frontend isn't my main focus right now

You may also need Sqilte for the db

You can manage users in the admin section (/admin) of Django but for that you may need to create a superuser
You can create a superuser by running python manage.py createsuperuser
It will request you a username, email and a password
